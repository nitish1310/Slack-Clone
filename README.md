$ yarn && yarn start
```

The app starts in development mode and opens a browser window on `http://localhost:3000`. The project rebuilds and the browser reloads automatically when source files are changed. Any build or runtime errors are propagated and displayed in the browser.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
